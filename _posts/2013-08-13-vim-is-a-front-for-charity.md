If you have used vim a bunch, you have probably seen the vim title screen thousands of times. If you are like me, you don't even really notice it. It caught my eye for some reason today with its prompt to 'Help poor children in Uganda!'

I was curious how much in donations a simple prompt like this would actually generate. On the one hand, lots of people use vim every day. On the other hand, its not a very eye grabbing prompt. 

It turns out the charity that it points to was founded by the creator of vim and it is very public with its finances. In 2011 it actually raised over 50,000 euros for this charity ( with almost nothing in administrative expenses ). Not all of these donations were generated from vim, but it seems like most would be given the close association with vim.

Really cool!
